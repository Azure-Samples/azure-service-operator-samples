# Contributing Guidelines

The Azure Service Operator Samples project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

Please see also the [Azure Service Operator Contribution Guide](https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator/contributing) for Azure Service Operator contributions.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a
couple of legal hurdles.

The [Microsoft CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/) must be signed by all contributors. Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Once you are CLA'ed, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have
signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.


## How to Contribute a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
2. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
3. Submit a pull request.

## Support Channels

This is an open source project and as such no formal support is available. However, like all good open source projects we do offer "best effort" support through github issues.

GitHub issues can be filed here - https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/issues

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.
